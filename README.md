# Deep Learning Models

Train and test different Python Keras Deep Learning models for different tasks and datasets.


## Models

The models are/can be trained on different datasets.
For now, there are:

-*Iris*: Recognize different Iris using their features

-*Cifar10*: Categorize different images (from plane to dog) by training on 60000 images.

## Deployment

You have to import all the modules from the requirements file, like this:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusions
There are different, high performance models, that you can train, test and use for your needs! ðŸ’¥
