# KERAS - MMM Finance Predictions

Train and test a Python Keras Deep Learning model to analyze MMM tickers stock market trend and make predictions.


## MMM dataset

Stock Market MMM is loaded by another code (not on this repo). It is a dataset of every MMM stock market closing prices from 1960 until these days.

## Deployment

You have to import all the modules from the requirements file, like this:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusions
The model has a very good MSE, less than 0,1 but its prediction logics aren't as good and need to be revisited. ðŸ’¥
