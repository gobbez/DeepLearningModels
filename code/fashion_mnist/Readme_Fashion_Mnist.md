# KERAS - Fashion Mnist

Train and test a Python Keras Deep Learning model to categorize different clothes images and use it on your own.


## Fashion-Mnist Dataset

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

## Deployment

You have to import all the modules from the requirements file, like this:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusions
The model has a 94% accuracy, but can be a bit of overfitting. ðŸ’¥
