# KERAS - CIFAR100 Deep Learning

Train and test a Python Keras Deep Learning model to categorize different images and use it on your own.


## Cifar-100 Dataset

This is a dataset of 50,000 32x32 color training images and 10,000 test images, labeled over 100 fine-grained classes that are grouped into 20 coarse-grained classes. 

## Deployment

You have to import all the modules from the requirements file, like this:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusions
The model stops at 45% accuracy, but you can increase it further. I stopped it since it was working fine. ðŸ’¥
